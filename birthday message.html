        <p> Hi maya.. K cha halkhabar ? </p>
<p> Malai timro lagi kei special garna manthiyo tara feri tadha basera dherai kei ni garna mildaina. Last birthday ma sangai huda paisa thiena.. ghar ramro thiena.. jatti sake garey. Timi khusi bhayau malai majja ayo. Espali sangai chainau tara I don’t want you to feel that I am not with you. You are an amazing person maya and I am so lucky to have known you for 2 years now. You always find ways to make me feel special and how could I miss an opportunity like this?</p>
<p> I hope you liked your gifts. The tshirt I have gifted you, it’s not merely a gift. It’s to symbolize your new beginning that you have collected enormous courage to embark. Maya I just want you to know.. jaile afulai man lageko kura gara, man lai khusi rakha. The way we have been raised it feels selfish to think just about ourselves. Sabbai kura ma selfish hau bhaneko haina, tara afno career to barema sochda ta paincha ni haina ra? Uncle aunty lai jhut bolera, major change garera padhna garo lagira hola.. tara socha ta timile ekdamai ramro gareu, timi stand out bhayau bhane your parents will be so proud. And as promised ma uncle sanga kura garchu timro graduation ko bela. Pinky promise. </p>
<p> Maya aile timi, ma.. hami.. we are at the bottom of stairs of success. Ya bata katti mathi jane sapana cha. Aile timile euta step chadera ladchu bhanera daraeu bhane agadi badhna sakkidaina. Etti tala chau ki ya bhanda tala jane thau chaina. Bhui bata ladera ta bhui mai hune ho.. tei bhaera mathi chadna nadaraunu hai? Timi ladeu ghau bhayo bhane niko parna lai timro nurse chu ni! </p>
<p> Enjoy growing up maya.. Feel the day. Jhyap nahunu. Ramro bani sika ani angaala. I love you to ocean city and back and forever and always </p>
